### What I learned

In this project I learned about the positioning of elements, using media queries and basic CSS properties, which will help me improve my knowledge and continue advancing in this world of web page design.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```
.layout {
  width: 100%;
  min-height: 100%;
  position: absolute;
  padding: 12rem 35rem;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: #f3e5d8;
}
```

- Grid
- JavaScript
- Among Others
